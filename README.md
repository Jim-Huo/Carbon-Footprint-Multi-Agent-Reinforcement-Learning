<br>This research paper intends to model the investment of groups of countries into carbon emission reductions based on a Mixed Markov Game setting, applying the principles of off-policy single-agent Reinforcement Learning to a multi-agent setting with a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
The study shows that countries which are choosing their carbon emission reduction actions under the constraint of optimizing their and their partnersâ€™ mid-term economic benefit, achieve both higher cumulative rewards and higher reductions in their per capita CO2 consumption, than their counterparts. It also shows that action choices considering immediate and future rewards for the individual agents, as well as the cumulative reward of all agents, converge to large reductions in the carbon emission level per capita of these countries. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) bears important problem-solving potential by modelling economic and political decision makers in simulated environments.
